Task 2

This assignment focuses on transshipments of a certain port. Each day, many vessels arrive in this port and are served by some stevedore(s). Four cargo types have been identified (ore, coal, oil, and petroleum), and vessels often carry a mixture of cargo types. For each unique vessel arrival (i.e. each row in the data), we would like a prediction of how much it transships (total of load & discharge activities) per cargo type. Variables of interest therefore are: discharge1, load1, discharge2, load2, discharge3, load3, discharge4 and load4.
